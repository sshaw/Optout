= Optout Changelog

== v0.0.2 (2012-01-05)

* Bug Fix: Validating that an option's value is in a set or is an instance of a class should not raise 
  an Optout::OptionRequired exception when the value is empty?
* Optout#argv and Optout#shell raise an ArgumentError if they're not passed a Hash
* Added required and optional methods
